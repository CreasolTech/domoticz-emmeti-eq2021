<img src="https://images.creasol.it/hotwater_eq2021.jpg" align="right" alt="EMMETI EQ2021 and EQ3021 image">

This is a plugin for the free open-source [Domoticz home automation system](https://www.domoticz.com) that **read and write some parameters from/to the [Emmeti EQ2021 hot-water heatpump](https://emmeti.com/en/products/air-conditioning/water-heater-with-heat-pump-inertial-accumulators-and-dhw-tanks-for-heat-pumps)** by Modbus connection (RS485 serial connection).

Using this plugin is possible to know the top and bottom boiler temperature, inlet/outlet air temperature, set the water temperature setpoint, ...

Plugin can be modified easily to support EQ3021 hot-water heat pump, that have an additional coil for solar panels.

Unfortunally, Modbus register documentation is very poor: if someone have an enhanced register description I'm happy to implement other features (for example activation/deactivation of the electric resistor, chiller, change operating mode, ....).

## Creasol DomBus modules

Below a list of modules, produced in Europe by Creasol, designed for Domoticz to be reliable and optimized for very very low power consumption.

Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power (**around 10mW with relays OFF**)
* reliable (**no disconnections**)
* bus connected (**no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**).

Modules are available in two version:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) only
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, working with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org)

### DomBusEVSE - EVSE module to build a Smart Wallbox / EV charging station
<a href="https://store.creasol.it/DomBusEVSE"><img src="https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_plug_300.webp" alt="DomBusEVSE smart EVSE module to make a Smart Wallbox EV Charging station" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" align="left" /></a>
Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* **Single-phase and three-phase**, up to 32A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes: in this case **the EVSE module can drain ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100% **minimizing the charge time and increasing the charging efficiency**.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work in *managed mode*, with an automation in the home automation system setting the charging current**
